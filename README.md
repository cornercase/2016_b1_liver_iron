This repo represents a snapshot of 3 separate repos at the time they were used to generate research results and analysis.

Some of the code is unpolished and is therefore provided without warranty.  Some of the scripts to generate images may be nonfunctional as a result of hard-coded paths to large binary files.

Code was developed in the Wood Lab at the University of Southern California.  Work was supported by NIH NIDDK R01DK097115.
